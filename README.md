Hi All!! Welcome to my tech demo session.
I have demonstrated a basic register/login application with angular routing feature and Firebase for authentication purpose.

Angular routing - As users perform application tasks, they need to move between the different views that you have defined. To handle the navigation from one view to the next, you use the Angular Router . The Router enables navigation by interpreting a browser URL as an instruction to change the view.

Also in my slides you could have seen the overview of Angular with its support tools, architecture, state management etc and a compariosn between React and Angular.

I hope you all have enjoyed my tech demo!!!

P.S: Extremely sorry for the length of my video I couldn't trim further. The main idea is to give a overview and on how to start a Angular project for the beginners like me and for the people who already have experience I hope this refreshes your basics.



# Myapp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.2.3.

## Install
Install the Node.js from `https://nodejs.org/en/download/` and check the version of the Node.js installed with command `node -v`

Run `npm install -g @angular/cli` for installing the Angular CLI

Run `npm install` for installing node_module packages and dependencies for the project

## Development server

Run `ng serve` or `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
